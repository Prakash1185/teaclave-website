On behalf of the Teaclave community, I am happy to announce the release of
Teaclave TrustZone SDK 0.8.0.

Teaclave empowers developers to build memory-safe Trusted Applications across
diverse confidential computing platforms, including Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone.
Apache Teaclave TrustZone SDK, a subproject of Apache Teaclave, is based on the
OP-TEE project, a widely used open-source TrustZone OS.

This release focuses on tooling improvements, ecosystem polish, and better build
compatibility, while keeping pace with upstream OP-TEE changes.

For more details, please refer to our release notes:
